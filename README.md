# Website

This is my website. My little corner of the internet which I plan to use as a sandbox - a place to experiement with web development. 

Every time I've tried to tackle this project in the past, I've always got caught up in learning a hot new framework and tried to make some complex single-page application. This time, we're going back to the roots. No front-end framework. No API. Let's just build a static website with HTML, CSS and JavaScript (if necessary). I only want to add additional complexity if absolutely necessary to hit the goal with a justifiable amount of effort.

Let's do this.
